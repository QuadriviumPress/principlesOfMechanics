## 2.1 Introduction

Mechanics is the science that studies the motion of objects and can be divided into the following:

1. Kinematics: Describes how objects move in terms of space and time.
2. Dynamics: Describes the cause of the object’s motion.
3. Statics: Deals with the conditions under which an object subjected to various forces is in equilibrium.

This chapter is considered with kinematics which answers many questions such as: How long it takes for an apple to reach the ground when it falls from a tree? What is the maximum height reached by a baseball when thrown into air? What is the distance it takes an airplane to take off?

In physics, there are three types of motion: translational, rotational, and vibrational. A block sliding on a surface is in translational motion, a (Merry-go-Round) is an example of rotational motion, and a mass–spring system when stretched and released is in vibrational motion. From here until Chap. [](#ch-7), the object studied will be treated as a particle (i.e., a point mass with no size). This assumption is possible only if the object moves in translational motion without rotating and by neglecting any internal motions that might exist in the object.

That is, an object can be treated as a particle only if all of its parts move in exactly the same way.

For example, if a man jumps into a pool without rotating by doing a somersault (freezing his body), he can be treated as a particle since all particles in his body will move in exactly the same way. Another example of an object that can be treated as a particle is the Earth in its motion about the Sun. Since the dimensions of the Earth are small compared to the dimensions of its path, it can be considered as a particle. The motion of an object is described either by equations or by graphs. Both ways provide information about the motion; however, equations provide precise information while graphs give greater insight about the motion.

## 2.2 Displacement, Velocity, and Acceleration

This section will discuss the concepts of displacement, velocity, and acceleration in one dimension. These concepts are essential in analyzing the motion of an object.

### 2.2.1 Displacement

Consider a car that is treated as a particle moving along the straight-line path shown in [](#fig-2-1). The $\mathrm{x}$-axis of a coordinate system is used to describe the position of the car with respect to the origin $\mathrm{O}$, where the points $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{Q}$ correspond to the positions $x_{i}$ at $t_{i}$ and $x_{f}$ at $t_{f}$, respectively. The position–time graph of this motion is shown in [](#fig-2-2). The displacement of the truck is a vector quantity defined as the change in its position during the time interval from $t_{i}$ to $t_{f}$ and is given by

```{math}
\triangle x=x_{f}-x_{i}
```

Hence displacement is a quantity that depends only on the initial and final positions of the object. The direction of the displacement in one dimension is specified by a plus or minus sign. It is positive if the particle is moving in the positive $\mathrm{x}$ direction and negative if the particle is moving in the negative $\mathrm{x}$ direction. In two or three dimensions, the displacement is represented by a vector. The SI unit of the displacement is the meter (m).

```

### 2.2.2 Average Speed

The average speed of an object is a scalar quantity defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time:

```{math}
\text{Average speed}=\frac{\text{Total distance traveled}}{\text{Total time}}
```

The SI unit of the average speed is meter per second $(\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})$.

### 2.2.3 Velocity

The average velocity $\overline{v}$ of an object is a vector quantity defined in terms of displacement rather than the total distance traveled:

```{math}
\overline{v}=\frac{\triangle x}{\triangle t}
```

$\overline{v}$ is positive if the motion is in the positive $\mathrm{x}$-direction and negative if it is in the negative $\mathrm{x}$-direction. On the position–time graph in [](#fig-2-2), $\overline{v}$ is the slope of the straight line connecting the points $\mathrm{P}$ and Q. The average velocity helps in describing the overall motion of the particle in a certain time interval. To describe the motion in more detail, the instantaneous velocity is defined. This velocity corresponds to the velocity of a particle at a particular time. That involves allowing $\triangle t$ to approach zero:

```{math}
v=\lim _{\triangle t\rightarrow \infty }\frac{\triangle x}{\triangle t}=\frac{dx}{dt}
```

Geometrically, the instantaneous velocity of a particle at a particular time on the position–time curve is the slope (the tangent) to the position–time curve at that point or instance (see [](#fig-2-3)). The SI unit of the velocity is $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$.

```{figure} ../images/ch-02/459974_1_En_2_Fig3_HTML.png

Geometrically, the instantaneous velocity of a particle at a particular time on the position-time curve is the slope (the tangent) to the position-time curve at that point or instance
```

### 2.2.4 Speed

The speed of the particle is defined as the magnitude of its velocity. Note that speed and average speed are different since speed is defined in terms of displacement, whereas average speed is defined in terms of the total distance traveled.

### 2.2.5 Acceleration

If the particle’s velocity changes with time, it is said to be accelerating. The average acceleration $\overline{a}$ of the particle is defined as the ratio of the change of its velocity $\triangle v$ to the time interval $\triangle t$:

```{math}
\overline{a}=\frac{\triangle v}{\triangle t}
```

The SI unit of acceleration is $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}$. The instantaneous acceleration is defined as

```{math}
a=\lim _{\triangle t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\triangle v}{\triangle t}=\frac{dv}{dt}
```

The average acceleration is the slope of the line joining the points $\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathrm{Q}$ on the velocity–time graph, whereas the instantaneous acceleration is the slope of the curve at a particular point (see [](#fig-2-4)). [](#fig-2-5) shows the position, velocity, and acceleration for a particle simultaneously.

## 2.3 Motion in Three Dimensions

Consider the particle moving from point $\mathrm{P}$ to point $\mathrm{Q}$ along a path or curve $\mathrm{C}$ during a time interval $\triangle t=t_{f}-t_{i}$ as shown in [](#fig-2-9). To locate the particle at any point the position vector $\mathbf{r}=x\mathbf{i}+y\mathbf{j}+z\mathbf{k}$ is used. $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $\mathbf{r}_{\mathrm{f}}$ corresponds to the position vectors of the particle at $t_{i}$ and $t_{f}$ respectively. A position vector should be drawn from a reference point (usually the origin of the coordinate system).

```{figure} ../images/ch-02/459974_1_En_2_Fig9_HTML.png
:name: fig-2-9
:alt: A particle moving from point P to point Q along a path or curve C during a time interval t=tf-ti

A particle moving from point $\mathrm{P}$ to point $\mathrm{Q}$ along a path or curve $\mathrm{C}$ during a time interval $\triangle t=t_{f}-t_{i}$
```

The displacement vector is then given by

```{math}
\triangle \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{f}-\mathbf{r}_{i}
```

The average velocity is

```{math}
\overline{\mathbf{v}}=\frac{\triangle \mathbf{r}}{\triangle t}=\frac{\mathbf{r}_{f}-\mathbf{r}_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}
```

The instantaneous velocity at a particular time is defined as

```{math}
\mathbf{v}=\lim _{\triangle t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\triangle \mathbf{r}}{\triangle t}=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}
```

As $\triangle t$ approaches zero, $\triangle \mathbf{r}$ becomes tangent to the path and it is replaced by $d\mathbf{r}$. The direction of $\mathrm{y}$ is in the direction of $dr$, hence, $\mathrm{y}$ is always tangent to the path at any point. In terms of components $\mathrm{y}$ is given by

```{math}
\mathbf{v}=\frac{dx}{dt}\mathbf{i}+\frac{dy}{dt}\mathbf{j}+\frac{dz}{dt}\mathbf{k}=v_{x}\mathbf{i}+v_{y}\mathbf{j}+v_{z}\mathbf{k}
```

The magnitude of the instantaneous velocity is

```{math}
|\mathbf{v}|=|\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}|=v=\sqrt{\left( \frac{dx}{dt}\right) ^{2}+\left( \frac{dy}{dt}\right) ^{2}+\left( \frac{dz}{dt}\right) ^{2}}=\frac{ds}{dt}
```

:name: fig-2-10
:alt: The instantaneous velocity vectors along the path

The instantaneous velocity vectors along the path
```

where $ds$ is the infinitesimal arc length along the path and comes from the fact that as $\triangle t$ approaches zero, the distance traveled by the particle along the path becomes equal to the vector displacement $|\triangle \mathbf{r}|$. [](#fig-2-10) shows the instantaneous velocities along the path. The average acceleration is

```{math}
\overline{\mathbf{a}}=\frac{\triangle \mathbf{v}}{\triangle t}=\frac{\mathbf{v}_{f}-\mathbf{v}_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}
```

The direction of $\overline{\mathbf{a}}$ is of the same direction as $\triangle \mathbf{v}$. The instantaneous acceleration is then

```{math}
\mathbf{a}=\lim _{\triangle t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\triangle \mathbf{v}}{\triangle t}=\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}
```

In terms of components

```{math}
\mathbf{a}=\frac{dv_{x}}{dt}\mathbf{i}+\frac{dv_{y}}{dt}\mathbf{j}+\frac{dv_{z}}{dt}\mathbf{k}=a_{x}\mathbf{i}+a_{y}\mathbf{j}+a_{z}\mathbf{k}
```

Another way to describe motion in three dimensions is by using spherical or cylindrical coordinates. In this book, we will only use rectangular coordinates for three-dimensional motion.

### 2.3.1 Normal and Tangential Components of Acceleration

The acceleration describes the change in both the magnitude and direction of the velocity. That is, the acceleration is not necessarily produced due to the change in the magnitude of the velocity only. Sometimes, it is produced due to the change in the direction of the velocity even if its magnitude is unchanged, and sometimes due to the change in both the magnitude and direction. Furthermore, the direction of $\mathbf{a}$ is not necessarily in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$. If $\mathbf{v}$ is changed in magnitude only (motion along a straight line) then $\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{v}$ if $\mathbf{v}$ is increasing, and antiparallel if $\mathbf{v}$ is decreasing. If $\mathbf{v}$ is changed in direction only (motion along a curved path with constant speed), then $\mathbf{a}$ is always perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}$ at any point (see [](#fig-2-11)). Finally, if $\mathbf{v}$ is changed in both magnitude and direction then $\mathbf{a}$ will be directed at some angle to $\mathbf{v}$ as in [](#fig-2-12).

```{figure} ../images/ch-02/459974_1_En_2_Fig11_HTML.png
:name: fig-2-11
:alt: If v is changed in magnitude only (motion along a straight line) then a is parallel to v if v is increasing, and antiparallel if v is decreasing. If v is changed in direction only (motion along a curved path with constant speed) then a is always perpendicular to v at any point

If $\mathbf{v}$ is changed in magnitude only (motion along a straight line) then $\mathbf{a}$ is parallel to $\mathbf{v}$ if $\mathbf{v}$ is increasing, and antiparallel if $\mathbf{v}$ is decreasing. If $\mathbf{v}$ is changed in direction only (motion along a curved path with constant speed) then $\mathbf{a}$ is always perpendicular to $\mathbf{v}$ at any point
```

In this case, the acceleration can be resolved into parallel and perpendicular components. The parallel component corresponds to the change in the magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$, while the perpendicular component corresponds to the change in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$. These components can be viewed to be directed along a rectangular coordinate system that moves with the particle (as it moves in space), where the particle is located at the origin of this coordinate system. The parallel (or tangential) component of the acceleration is always tangent to the path while the perpendicular (or normal) component is normal to the path at each point as shown in [](#fig-2-13).

[](#fig-2-14) shows the direction of the acceleration of a car moving down a ramp under the influence of gravity.

In terms of unit vectors, let $\mathbf{T}$ be the unit vector along the tangent axis, $\mathbf{N}$ is the unit vector along the normal axis (also called the principal unit normal vector) and $\mathbf{B}$ a third unit vector called the binormal vector defined by $\mathbf{B}= \mathbf{T}\times \mathbf{N}$. These unit vectors form a frame called the TNB frame, where it moves with the particle (see [](#fig-2-15)). Since $\mathbf{v}$ is always tangent to the path we may write

```{math}
\mathbf{T}=\frac{\mathbf{v}}{|\mathbf{v}|}=\frac{d\mathbf{r}/dt}{|d\mathbf{r}/dt|}=\frac{d\mathbf{r}/dt}{ds/dt}
```

At $\mathrm{A}$ the acceleration of a car is in the same direction of the velocity since the latter changes only in magnitude. As it moves its velocity is changed in both magnitude and direction. Therefore at $\mathrm{B}$ the direction of the acceleration is at some angle to the velocity. At $\mathrm{C}$ the speed reaches a maximum and therefore the instantaneous change of speed is zero at this point and the acceleration has only a perpendicular component. As the car moves up its velocity decreases and changes in direction also, thus the acceleration has both parallel and perpendicular components. Finally at $\mathrm{E}$, the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the velocity since the velocity is decreasing but its direction is the same

```

Because $\mathbf{T}$ is a unit vector we have $\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{T}=1$, differentiating this with respect to $s$ gives

```{math}
\mathbf{T}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}+\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}\cdot \mathbf{T}=2\mathbf{T}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}=0
```

or

```{math}
\mathbf{T}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}=0
```

Hence, $\mathbf{T}$ is perpendicular to $d\mathbf{T}/ds$. Since $\mathbf{N}$ is also perpendicular to $\mathbf{T}$, then we have

```{math}
\mathbf{N}=\frac{d\mathbf{T}/ds}{|d\mathbf{T}/ds|}=\frac{1}{k}\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}
```

$k$ is called the curvature of $\mathrm{C}$ at a certain point and it has the value $k= |d\mathbf{T}/ds|$. The quantity $R=1/k$ is the radius of curvature at that point. Thus, $\mathbf{N}=R(d\mathbf{T}/ds)$. The total acceleration of the particle in terms of the unit tangent $\mathbf{T}$ vector and the principal unit normal vector $\mathbf{N}$ can be written as

```{math}
:label: eq-2-2

\mathbf{a}=\frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(v\mathbf{T})=\frac{dv}{dt}\mathbf{T}+v\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{dt}
```

Furthermore,

```{math}
:label: eq-2-3

\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{dt}=\frac{d\mathbf{T}}{ds}\frac{ds}{dt}=\frac{\mathbf{N}}{R}\frac{ds}{dt}=\frac{v\mathbf{N}}{R}
```

Substituting Eq. [](#eq-2-2) into Eq. [](#eq-2-3) gives

```{math}
\mathbf{a}=\frac{dv}{dt}\mathbf{T}+\frac{v^{2}}{R}\mathbf{N}
```

Therefore, $a_{n}=v^{2}/R$ and $a_{t}=dv/dt$. Note that unlike $d|\mathbf{v}|/dt$, $|d\mathbf{v}/dt|$ corresponds to the change in the magnitude of the velocity or in its direction or in both (as it represents the magnitude of the total acceleration vector), whereas $d|\mathbf{v}|/dt$ corresponds to the change in the magnitude only.

### 2.4.1 One-Dimensional Motion with Constant Acceleration

An acceleration that does not change with time is said to be a constant or uniform acceleration. In that case, the average and instantaneous accelerations are equal. This type of motion is more easily analyzed than when the acceleration is varied. Since the motion is in one dimension, it follows that the $y$ and $z$ components are zero. That is,

```{math}
\mathbf{r}=x\mathbf{i}
```

```{math}
\triangle \mathbf{r}=(x_{f}-x_{i})\mathbf{i}
```

Hence, as we’ve mentioned earlier, the direction of the displacement can be specified with a plus or minus sign, as well as the directions of the velocity and acceleration. Let us assume that $t_{i}=0$, $t_{f}=t$, $v_{xf}=v$, $v_{xi}=v_{0}$, $x_{i}=x_{0}$ and $x_{f}=x$. Since the acceleration is constant, the velocity will vary linearly with time, and thus the average velocity can be expressed as

```{math}
\overline{v}=\frac{v_{0}+v}{2}
```

```{math}
a=\overline{a}=\frac{v_{f}-v_{i}}{t_{f}-t_{i}}=\frac{v-v_{0}}{t}
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-4

v=v_{0}+at
```

```{math}
\overline{v}=\frac{\triangle x}{\triangle t}=\frac{(v+v_{0})}{2}
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-5

x-x_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(v+v_{0})t
```

Furthermore,

```{math}
x-x_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(v+v_{0})t=\frac{1}{2}(v_{0}+v_{0}+at)t
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-6

x-x_{0}=v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}
```

Finally,

```{math}
x-x_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(v+v_{0})t=\frac{1}{2}(v+v_{0})\left( \frac{v-v_{0}}{a}\right)
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-7

v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}+2a(x-x_{0})
```

Equations [](#eq-2-4), [](#eq-2-5), [](#eq-2-6), and [](#eq-2-7) are called the kinematic equations for motion in a straight line under constant acceleration. The motion graphs for an object moving with constant acceleration in the positive $\mathrm{x}$-direction are shown in [](#fig-2-17).

(b) What is the distance traveled by both during that time? (c) How much time has passed from where the car passed the police car to where it was caught?

:::{admonition} Solution 2.9
:class: dropdown

Let’s assume that $x=0$ at where the car passed the police car and that $t=0$ at the instant the police car begins to accelerate. The velocity of the car is equal to 38.9 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$, and the initial velocity and acceleration of the police car are 22.2 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and 1.1 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}$, respectively The police will catch the car when both their displacements from $x=0$ are equal. (a) From the expression $x= x_{0}+v_{0}t+\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$, the displacement of the car at any time is

```{math}
x_{c}=x_{0c}+v_{0c}t=(194.5\,\mathrm{m})+(38.9\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})t

The displacement of the police car at any time is

```{math}
x_{p}=x_{0p}+v_{0p}t+\frac{1}{2}a_{p}t^{2}=(111\,\mathrm{m})+(22.2\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})t+\frac{1}{2}(1.1\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2})t^{2}
```

The police will catch the car when $x_{c}=x_{p}$, and therefore if $(194.5\,\mathrm{m})+(38.9\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})t=(111\,\mathrm{m})+(22.2\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})t+\frac{1}{2}(1.1\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2})t^{2}$ or

Thus

### 2.4.2 Free-Falling Objects

Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) was an Italian scientist, who studied and experimented the acceleration of falling objects. By dropping various objects from the Leaning Tower of Pisa (or by releasing objects from inclined planes according to another story), Galileo discovered that when air resistance is neglected then all objects would fall with the same constant acceleration regardless of their mass or size. This acceleration, denoted by *g*, is known as the free-fall acceleration since air resistance is neglected and the object is assumed to be moving freely under gravity alone. The direction of the vector $\mathbf{g}$ is downwards toward the earth’s center. However, *g* varies with altitude as well as other factors which will be discussed in Chap. [](#ch-9).

In solving problems involving objects falling near the surface of the earth, $g$ can be assumed to be constant with a value of 9.8 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}$ and air resistance can be neglected. A free-falling motion is a motion along a straight line (for example along the $\mathrm{y}$-axis) where objects may move upwards or downwards. The kinematics equations of the free-falling motion with constant acceleration can be found from Eqs. ([](#eq-2-4)), ([](#eq-2-5)), ([](#eq-2-6)), and ([](#eq-2-7)) by simply replacing $x$ with $y$ and $a$ with $g$. If the positive direction of $y$ is chosen to be upwards, then the acceleration is negative (downwards) and is given by $(a=-g)$. These substitutions give

```{math}
v=v_{0}-gt
```

```{math}
y-y_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(v+v_{0})t
```

```{math}
y-y_{0}=v_{0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}
```

```{math}
v^{2}=v_{0}^{2}-2g(y-y_{0})
```

The displacement and velocity graphs are shown in [](#fig-2-18). Note that it does not matter whether the object is falling or moving upward, it will experience the same acceleration $g$ which is directed downwards. [](#fig-2-19) shows the important features of a free-falling object that is dropped from rest.

A ball is thrown directly upwards with an initial velocity of 15 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$. On its way down, it was caught at a distance of 1 m below the point from where it was thrown.

(a) First we take $y=0$ at the position where the ball is thrown and positive $y$ to be upwards. At the maximum height the velocity of the ball is zero,

or

at $t=2\,\mathrm{s}$, $v_{x}=-8\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$, $v_{y}=-16\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ and the velocity is

### 2.4.4 Projectile Motion

Projectile motion is the motion of an object thrown (projected) into the air at some angle with respect to the surface of the earth, such as the motion of a baseball thrown into the air or an object dropped from a moving airplane. In the simplified model where air resistance as well as other factors such as the Earth’s curvature and rotation are neglected, and if the free-fall acceleration $\mathbf{g}$ is assumed constant in magnitude and direction throughout the motion of the object, then the path of the projectile is always a parabola that depends on the magnitude and direction of its initial velocity. Therefore, the projectile can be considered as a combination of a vertical motion with a constant acceleration directed downwards and a horizontal motion with zero acceleration (constant velocity). We can see from [](#fig-2-21) that

```{figure} ../images/ch-02/459974_1_En_2_Fig21_HTML.png
:name: fig-2-21
:alt: The projectile motion

The projectile motion
```

```{math}
\cos \theta _{0}={v_{0x}}/v_{o}
```

```{math}
\sin \theta _{0}={v_{0y}}/v_{o}
```

At $t=0$, we have $x_{0}=y_{0}=0$ and $v_{i}=v_{0}$. Because $a_{y}=-g$ and $a_{x}=0$ and by substituting in Eqs. [](#eq-2-8), [](#eq-2-9), [](#eq-2-10), and [](#eq-2-11) gives

```{math}
:label: eq-2-14

v_{x}=v_{0x}=v_{0}\cos \theta _{0}= \text {constant}
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-15

v_{y}=v_{y0}-gt=v_{0}\sin \theta _{0}-gt
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-16

x=v_{x0}t=(v_{0}\cos \theta _{0})t
```

```{math}
:label: eq-2-17

y=v_{y0}t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}=(v_{0}\sin \theta _{0})t-\frac{1}{2}gt^{2}
```

Combining and eliminating $t$ from Eqs. [](#eq-2-16) and [](#eq-2-17) we find that

```{math}
y=(\tan \theta _{0})x-\bigg (\frac{g}{2v_{0}^{2}\cos ^{2}\theta _{0}}\bigg )x^{2} \quad \left(0<\theta _{0}<\frac{\pi }{2}\right)
```

This equation which is of the form $y=ax-bx^{2}$ ($a$ and $b$ are constants), is the equation of a parabola. Therefore, when air resistance is neglected (when using the simplified model of the system), the trajectory of the projectile is always a parabola. At any instant, the velocity of the object is tangent to its trajectory Its magnitude and direction with respect to the positive $\mathrm{x}$-direction are given by

```{math}
v=\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}
```

and

```{math}
\theta =\tan ^{-1} {(v_{y}/v_{x})}
```

respectively The maximum height $h$ of the projectile, as in [](#fig-2-22), is found at $t=t_{1}$ by noting that at the peak $h$, $v_{y}=0$. Substituting this in Eq. [](#eq-2-15) gives

```{math}
v_{0}\sin \theta _{0}=gt_{1}
```

```{math}
t_{1}=\frac{v_{0}\sin \theta _{0}}{g}
```

Substituting $t_{1}$ into Eq. [](#eq-2-17) we get

```{math}
y_{\max }=h=(v_{0}\sin \theta _{0})t_{1}-\frac{1}{2}gt_{1}^{2}
```

```{math}
h=(v_{0}\sin \theta _{0})\bigg (\frac{v_{0}\sin \theta _{0}}{g}\bigg )-\frac{1}{2}g\bigg (\frac{v_{0}\sin \theta _{0}}{g}\bigg )^{2}
```

```{math}
h=\frac{v_{0}^{2}\sin ^{2}\theta _{0}}{2g}
```

The maximum range $R$ is at $t=2t_{1}$. Substituting $t$ into Eq. [](#eq-2-16) gives

```{math}
x=R=(v_{0}\cos \theta _{0})2t_{1}=(v_{0}\cos \theta _{0})\frac{2v_{0}\sin \theta _{0}}{g}=\frac{2v_{0}^{2}\sin \theta _{0}\cos \theta _{0}}{g}

### 2.4.5 Uniform Circular Motion

A particle moving in a circular path with constant speed is said to be in uniform circular motion. The motion of the moon about earth, and the motion of clothes in a washing machine are examples of uniform circular motion. In this motion, the direction of the velocity of the particle is continuously changing but its magnitude is constant. As we have mentioned in Sect. [](#sec-2-3-1), when only the direction of the velocity changes, the acceleration is then always perpendicular to the velocity at any time. Therefore, we have only the normal component of the acceleration $a_{n}=v^{2}/R$, and the tangential component of the acceleration $a_{t}=dv/dt$ is zero. In the case of the circular path the radius of curvature $R$ is constant, denoted by $r$, and the normal acceleration is directed along the radius of the circle

```{math}
a_{rad}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}
```

The subscript rad is for radial. Thus, this radial or centripetal acceleration $a_{rad}$ is always directed toward the center of the circle. Therefore, the directions of $\mathbf{v}$ and a change continuously with time but their magnitudes are constant (see [](#fig-2-23)). The time required for the particle to complete one revolution around the circle is called the period of revolution and is given by

```{math}
T=\frac{2\pi r}{v}
```

Thus

```{math}
a_{rad}=\frac{4\pi ^{2}r}{T^{2}}
```

### 2.4.6 Nonuniform Circular Motion

In nonuniform circular motion, the velocity of the particle varies in both magnitude and direction. As mentioned in Sect. [](#sec-2-3-1), when both the magnitude and direction of the particle’s velocity change then its acceleration is directed at some angle to $\mathbf{v}$. Thus, in addition to the normal acceleration in uniform circular motion that corresponds to the change in the direction of $\mathbf{v}$, there is a tangential component that corresponds to the change in the magnitude of $\mathbf{v}$. Furthermore $a_{rad}$ is not constant since $\mathbf{v}$ changes with time. Therefore, the resultant acceleration is

```{math}
\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{a}_{n}+\mathbf{a}_{t}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}\mathbf{N}+\frac{d|\mathbf{v}|}{dt}\mathbf{T}
```

In Chap. [](#ch-8), the concepts of angular velocity and acceleration and their vector relationship with the normal and tangential accelerations are introduced. [](#fig-2-24) shows the velocity and total acceleration vectors of a particle moving in a circular path with increasing speed (clockwise) until it reaches the maximum speed at the bottom, and then slows down as it goes back up. An example of this motion is in a roller coaster ride in a vertical circle.

:::{admonition} Solution 2.17

Since both the direction and the magnitude of the car’s velocity change, its total acceleration is the vector sum of its tangential and radial accelerations. The tangential acceleration is

When $v=40\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}=11.1\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ the radial acceleration is

```{math}
a_{rad}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}=\frac{(11.1\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s})^{2}}{(20\,\mathrm{m})}=6.2\,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}

## 2.5 Relative Velocity

In this section, we will see how observers moving relative to each other obtain different results when measuring the velocity of a moving body. Suppose two cars are moving besides each other at the same speed of 120 $\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}$ with respect to earth. In this case, any of the two cars is at rest relative to the other. According to an observer who is stationary with respect to earth, each car is moving with a speed of 120 $\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$. A second observer, in any of the cars, will see the stationary observer moving backwards at a speed of 120 $\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}$. In addition, if a third car is moving ahead of the two cars at a speed of 140 $\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}$ relative to earth, then its speed relative to an observer in any of the two cars is 20 $\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$. Thus, the displacement and velocities may have different values when measured relative to different observers. Therefore, the description of motion depends on the observer. By attaching a coordinate system to an observer together with an appropriate time scale, he or she are then said to be in a reference frame. In measuring quantities, it is essential to specify the reference frame. In most situations, the earth (the lab) is used as our frame of reference. To understand this, consider a particle moving in one dimension in the positive $\mathrm{x}$-direction. Suppose two observers want to describe its motion, one is observer $\mathrm{S}$ who is stationary relative to the ground, and the other is observer $\mathrm{S}'$, who is moving in the positive $\mathrm{x}$-direction with a constant velocity relative to the ground (see [](#fig-2-25)). At any instant, the position of the particle relative to $\mathrm{S}$ is $x_{PS}$, and its position relative to $\mathrm{S}'$ is $x_{PS'}$. The relation between these two observations is

```{math}
:label: eq-2-18

x_{PS}=x_{PS'}+x_{S'S}
```

Therefore, the position of $\mathrm{P}$ relative to $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{S}}$ is equal to the position of $\mathrm{P}$ relative to $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{S}'}$ plus the distance between $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{S}}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{\mathrm{S}'}$. Differentiating Eq. [](#eq-2-18) with respect to time we get

```{math}
\frac{dx_{PS}}{dt}=\frac{dx_{PS'}}{dt}+\frac{dx_{S'S}}{dt}
```

or

```{math}
v_{PS}=v_{PS'}+v_{S'S}
```

We will extend this to three dimensions in the case where the velocity of $\mathrm{S}'$ with respect to $\mathrm{S}(v_{S'S})$ is constant in both magnitude and direction (see [](#fig-2-26)). The position vector of the particle $\mathrm{P}$ relative to $\mathrm{S}$ is given by

```{math}
:label: eq-2-19

\mathbf{r}_{PS}=\mathbf{r}_{PS'}+\mathbf{r}_{S'S}
```

Differentiating this with respect to time gives

```{math}
:label: eq-2-20

\mathbf{v}_{PS}=\mathbf{v}_{PS'}+\mathbf{v}_{S'S}
```

Equations [](#eq-2-19) and [](#eq-2-20) are called the Galilean transformation equations. In addition, for any two frames of reference $\mathrm{S}$ and $\mathrm{S}$ we have

```{math}
\mathbf{v}_{SS'}=-\mathbf{v}_{S'S}

:::{admonition} Solution 2.19
:class: dropdown

Using [](#fig-2-26), consider the Earth as S (denoted E), the waves as $\mathrm{S}'$, and the boat as the point P. As we can see from [](#fig-2-29), the velocity of the boat relative to the earth is given by $\mathbf{v}_{bE}=\mathbf{v}_{bw}+\mathbf{v}_{wE}$, where $\mathbf{v}_{bw}$ and $\mathbf{v}_{wE}$ are the velocities of the boat relative to the waves and the velocity of the waves relative to the earth respectively With the east as the direction of the positive $\mathrm{x}$-axis we get

```{math}
v_{(bE)y}=v_{(bw)y}+v_{(wE)y}=(8\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h})+(4\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}) \sin 45^{\circ } =10.83\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}
```

```{math}
v_{(bE)x}=v_{(wE)x}=(4\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}) \cos 45^{\circ } =2.83\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}

v_{bE}=\sqrt{(v_{(bE)x})^{2}+(v_{(bE)y})^{2}}=\sqrt{(10.83\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h})^{2}+(2.83\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h})^{2}}=11.2\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}
```

The direction of $\mathbf{v}_{bE}$ is

```{math}
\theta =\tan ^{-1}\frac{(v_{bE})_{y}}{(v_{bE})_{x}}=\tan ^{-1}\frac{(10.83\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h})}{(2.83\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h})}=75.35^{\circ}

## 2.6 Motion in a Plane Using Polar Coordinates

Consider a particle moving in the x–y plane. A useful way to describe the position, velocity, and acceleration of the particle is by using its polar coordinates $(r,\theta )$. The relationship between the polar and rectangular coordinates is

```{math}
x=r\cos \theta
```

```{math}
y=r\sin \theta
```

where $\theta$ is measured from the positive $\mathrm{x}$- axis. Suppose a particle is located at $(r,\theta )$. If the particle moves in a straight line along the $r$ direction, then $\theta$ is constant through the motion of the particle. If the particle moves in a circle, then $r$ is constant. Let $\mathrm{r}_{1}$ be a unit vector along the increasing $r$ direction and $\theta _{1}$ to be a unit vector in the direction of increasing $\theta$ (anticlockwise direction). From [](#fig-2-30), we have

```{math}
\mathbf{r}_{1}=\cos \theta \mathbf{i}+\sin \theta \mathbf{j}
```

and

```{math}
\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}=-\sin \theta \mathbf{i}+\cos \theta \mathbf{j}
```

Unlike the rectangular unit vectors, the polar unit vectors are not fixed in direction. Their direction changes as the particle moves along some path. Therefore, when finding the velocity and acceleration of a particle the derivatives of the polar unit vectors must be considered. The position vector of the particle is given by

```{math}
\mathbf{r}=r\mathbf{r}_{1}
```

To find the velocity in terms of the polar unit vectors let us differentiate $\mathbf{r}_{1}$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}$ with respect to time. That gives

```{math}
\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{1}=\frac{d\mathbf{r}_{1}}{dt}=-\sin \theta \frac{d\theta }{dt}\mathbf{i}+\cos \theta \frac{d\theta }{dt}\mathbf{j}=\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}\frac{d\theta }{dt}=\dot{\theta }\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}
```

```{math}
\dot{\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}}=\frac{d{\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}}}{dt}=-\cos \theta \frac{d\theta }{dt} \mathbf{i}-\sin \theta \frac{d\theta }{dt}\mathbf{j}=-\mathbf{r}_{1}\frac{d\theta }{dt}=-\dot{\theta }\mathbf{r}_{1}
```

The velocity of the particle is given by

```{math}
\mathbf{v}=\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(r\mathbf{r}_{1})=\frac{dr}{dt}\mathbf{r}_{1}+r\frac{d\mathbf{r}_{1}}{dt}=\dot{r}\mathbf{r}_{1}+r\dot{\mathbf{r}}_{1}=\dot{r}\mathbf{r}_{1}+r\dot{\theta }{\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}}
```

Hence, the velocity is ([](#fig-2-31))

```{math}
:label: eq-2-21

\mathbf{v}=\dot{r}\mathbf{r}_{1}+r\dot{\theta }{\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}}
```

We may write

```{math}
\mathbf{v}=v_{r}\mathbf{r}_{1}+v_{\theta }{\boldsymbol{\theta _{1}}}
```

An aircraft is tracked by a radar (see [](#fig-2-36)). If at a certain instant the radar measurements give $r=7 \times 10^4 \,\mathrm{m}$, $\dot{r}=1000 \,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$, $\ddot{r}=7 \,\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}^{2}$, $\theta =45^{\circ}$, $\dot{\theta }=0.6 \,\mathrm{deg}/\mathrm{s}$, and $\ddot{\theta }=0.02 \,\mathrm{deg}/\mathrm{s}^{2}$. Find the velocity and acceleration of the airplane at that instant.
