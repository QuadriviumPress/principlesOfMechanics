## 7.1 Rotational Motion

Rotational motion exists everywhere in the universe. The motion of electrons about an atom and the motion of the moon about the earth are examples of rotational motion. Objects cannot be treated as particles when exhibiting rotational motion since different parts of the object move with different velocities and accelerations. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the object as a system of particles.

## 7.2 The Plane Motion of a Rigid Body

When all parts of a rigid body move parallel to a fixed plane, then the motion of the object is referred to as plane motion. There are two types of plane motion, which are given as follows:
1. The pure rotational motion: The rigid body in such a motion rotates about a fixed axis that is perpendicular to a fixed plane. In other words, the axis is fixed and does not move or change its direction relative to an inertial frame of reference.
2. The general plane motion: The motion here can be considered as a combination of pure translational motion parallel to a fixed plane in addition to a pure rotational motion about an axis that is perpendicular to that plane. This chapter discusses the kinematics and dynamics of pure rotational motion.

### 7.2.1 The Rotational Variables

Suppose a rigid body of an arbitrary shape is in pure rotational motion about the $\mathrm {z}$-axis (see Fig. [](#fig-7-1)). Let us analyze the motion of a particle that lies in a slice of the body in the x-y plane as in Fig. [](#fig-7-2). This particle (at point P) will rotate in a circle of fixed radius *r* which represents the perpendicular distance from $\mathrm {P}$ to the axis of rotation. If you look at any other particle in the object you will see that every particle will rotate in its own circle that has the axis of rotation at its center. In other words, different particles move in different circles but the center of all of these circles lies on the rotational axis. Suppose the particle moves through an arc length *s* starting at the positive $\mathrm {x}$-axis. Its angular position is then given by
```{math}
\theta =\frac{s}{r}
```
*r* and $\theta$ are the polar coordinates of a point in a plane (which was mentioned in Sect. 2.6) where $\theta$ is always measured from the positive $\mathrm {x}$-axis. Because $\theta$ is the ratio of the arc length to the radius, it is a pure (dimensionless) number. The unit usually used to measure $\theta$ is the radians (rad). One radian is defined as the angle subtended by an arc of length that is equal to the radius of the circle. Since one rotation ($360^{\circ }$) corresponds to $\theta =2\pi r/r=2\pi$ rad, it follows that:
```{math}
1 \; \text {rev} =360^{\circ }=2\pi \; \text {rad}
```
```{math}
1 \; \text {rad} =57.3^{\circ }=0.159 \; \text {rev}
```
Note that if the particle completes one revolution, $\theta$ will not become zero again, it is then equal to $2\pi \mathrm {r}\mathrm {a}\mathrm {d}$. Thus for example for three revolutions the angular position is given by
```{math}
\theta =(2\pi +2\pi +2\pi ) \; \text {rad} =6\pi \; \text {rad}
```
Suppose that the particle in Fig. [](#fig-7-2) is at point $P_{1}$ at $t_{1}$ and at point $P_{2}$ at $t_{2}$ where it changes its angular position from $\theta _{1}$ to $\theta _{2}$ (see Fig. [](#fig-7-3)). Its angular displacement is then given by
```{math}
\triangle \theta =\theta _{2}-\theta _{1}
```
$\triangle \theta$ is positive for counterclockwise rotations (increasing $\theta$) and negative for clockwise rotations (decreasing $\theta$). If the particle undergoes this angular displacement during a time interval $\triangle t$, the average angular velocity $\overline{\omega }$ is then defined as
```{math}
\overline{\omega }=\frac{\theta _{2}-\theta _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\frac{\triangle \theta }{\triangle t}
```
The instantaneous angular velocity is

```
```{math}
\omega =\lim _{\triangle t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\triangle \theta }{\triangle t}=\frac{d\theta }{dt}
```
$\omega$ has units of $\mathrm {r}\mathrm {a}\mathrm {d}/\mathrm {s}$ or $\mathrm {s}^{-1}$. The average angular acceleration is defined as
```{math}
\overline{\alpha }=\frac{\omega _{2}-\omega _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\frac{\triangle \omega }{\triangle t}
```
The instantaneous angular acceleration is
```{math}
\alpha =\lim _{\triangle t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\triangle \omega }{\triangle t}=\frac{d\omega }{dt}
```
where $\alpha$ is in $\mathrm {r}\mathrm {a}\mathrm {d}/\mathrm {s}^{2}$ or $\mathrm {s}^{-2}$. Note that $\omega$ is positive for increasing $\theta$ and negative for decreasing $\theta$, while $\alpha$ is positive for increasing $\omega$ and negative for decreasing $\omega$. When a rigid body is in pure rotational motion, all particles in the body rotate through the same angle during the same time interval. Thus, all particles have the same angular velocity and the same angular acceleration. Therefore, $\omega$ and $\alpha$ describes the motion of the whole body In the case of pure rotational motion, the direction of $\omega$ is along the axis of rotation (also see Sect. [](#sec-7-4)), it can be determined by the right-hand rule or of advance of a right-handed screw as in Fig. [](#fig-7-4). The direction of $\alpha$ is in the same direction of $\omega$ if $\omega$ is increasing or in the opposite direction if $\omega$ is decreasing.
The quantities $\theta , \omega$ and $\alpha$ in pure rotational motion are the rotational analog of *x*, *v* and *a* in translational one-dimensional motion. The vectors $\omega$ and $\alpha$ are not used in the case of pure rotational motion, they are used in the general rotational motion when the axis of rotation changes its direction with time. Note that only the infinitesimal angular displacement $d\theta$ can be represented by a vector but not the finite angular displacement $\triangle \theta$. This is because the finite angular displacement $\triangle \theta$ does not obey the commutative law of vector addition (see Fig. [](#fig-7-5)) and therefore cannot be represented by a vector. Hence, the instantaneous angular velocity and acceleration ($\omega$ and $\alpha$) can be represented by vectors but not their average values ($\overline{\omega }$ and $\overline{\alpha }$).

A pure rotational motion with constant angular acceleration is the rotational analogue of the pure translational motion with constant acceleration. The corresponding kinematic equations of pure rotational motion can be obtained by using the same method that is used for obtaining the kinematic equations of pure translational motion. To show this, consider a rigid object rotating with a constant angular acceleration during a time interval from $t_{1}$ to $t_{2}$ through an angle from $\theta _{1}$ to $\theta _{2}$. Let $t_{1}=0, t_{2}=t, \omega _{1}=\omega _{\mathrm {o}}, \omega _{2}=\omega , \theta _{1}=\theta _{\mathrm {o}}$, and $\theta _{2}=\theta .$ Because the angular acceleration is constant it follows that the angular velocity changes linearly with time and the average angular velocity is given by
```{math}
\overline{\omega }=\frac{\omega _{0}+\omega }{2}
```
Since
```{math}
\alpha =\overline{\alpha }=\frac{\omega _{2}-\omega _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\frac{\omega -\omega _{0}}{t}
```
we have
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \omega =\omega _{0}+\alpha t \end{aligned}
```
Furthermore
```{math}
\overline{\omega }=\frac{\theta _{2}-\theta _{1}}{t_{2}-t_{1}}=\frac{\theta -\theta _{0}}{t}=\frac{\omega _{0}+\omega }{2}
```
Hence
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \theta =\theta _{0}+\frac{1}{2}(\omega _{0}+\omega )t \end{aligned}
```
Substituting Eq. 7.1 into Eq. 7.2 gives
```{math}
\theta =\theta _{0}+\frac{1}{2}(\omega _{0}+\omega )t=\theta _{0}+\frac{1}{2}(\omega _{0}+\omega _{0}+\alpha t)t
```
or
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \displaystyle \theta =\theta _{0}+\omega _{0}t+\frac{1}{2}\alpha t^{2} \end{aligned}
```
Finally solving for *t* from Eq. 7.1 and substituting into Eq. 7.2 gives
```{math}
\theta =\theta _{0}+\frac{1}{2}(\omega _{0}+\omega )t=\theta _{0}+\frac{1}{2}(\omega _{0}+\omega )\left( \frac{\omega -\omega _{0}}{\alpha }\right)
```
or
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \omega ^{2}=\omega _{0}^{2}+2\alpha (\theta -\theta _{0}) \end{aligned}
```
Note that as mentioned earlier, if a rigid object is in pure rotational motion, all particles in the object have the same angular velocity and angular acceleration. Different particles move in different circles but the center of these circles lies at the axis of rotation. As the rigid body rotates, a particle in the body will move through a distance *s* along its circular path (see Fig. [](#fig-7-6)). The angular displacement of the particle is related to *s* by
```{math}
s=r\theta
```
where *r* is the radius of the circle in which the particle is moving along. Differentiating the above equation with respect to *t* gives
```{math}
\frac{ds}{dt}=r\frac{d\theta }{dt}
```
Since *ds* / *dt* is the magnitude of the linear velocity of the particle and $d\theta /dt$ is the angular velocity of the body we may write
```{math}
\begin{aligned} v=r\omega \end{aligned}
```
Therefore, the farther the particle is from the rotational axis the greater its linear speed. The direction of the linear speed of the particles is always tangent to the path (as mentioned in Sect. 2.2.3). In Sect. 2.4.6 we have seen that a particle in nonuniform circular motion has both tangential and radial components of acceleration. The radial component is due to the change in the direction of the velocity and is given by
```{math}
\begin{aligned} a_{r}=\displaystyle \frac{v^{2}}{r} \end{aligned}
```
Substituting Eq. 7.5 into Eq. 7.6 gives
```{math}
a_{r}=\frac{v^{2}}{r}=r\omega ^{2}
```
The tangential component of the acceleration is due to the change in the magnitude of the velocity and it is given by
```{math}
a_{t}=\frac{dv}{dt}=r\frac{d\omega }{dt}
```
or
```{math}
a_{t}=r\alpha
```
The total linear acceleration of the particle (see Fig. [](#fig-7-7)) is given by
```{math}
\mathbf {a}=\mathbf {a}_t+\mathbf {a}_r
```
It’s magnitude is given by
```{math}
a=\sqrt{{a_t}^2+{a_r}^2}=\sqrt{{r}^2{\alpha }^2+{r}^2{\omega }^4}=r\sqrt{{\alpha }^2+{\omega }^4}
```
Table. 7.1 shows the linear/rotational analogous equations.

## 7.4 Vector Relationship Between Angular and Linear Variables

Consider a rigid body in pure rotational motion about a fixed axis (for example the $\mathrm {z}$-axis). For any particle in the object, its linear velocity is given by
```{math}
v=r\omega =R\sin \theta \omega
```
where $\mathrm {R}$ is the position vector of the particle from the origin (see Fig. [](#fig-7-9)) and $\theta$ is the angle between the position vector and the $\mathrm {z}$-axis. As shown in Fig. [](#fig-7-9), the direction of $\mathrm {y}$ is perpendicular to the plane formed by $\omega$ and $\mathrm {R}$ where it can be verified using the right-hand rule. Therefore, by using the definition of vector product we may write
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \mathbf {v}=\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {R} \end{aligned}
```
The total linear acceleration is
```{math}
\mathbf {a}=\frac{d\mathbf {v}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {R})
```
From Sect. 1.9.1 $(d/dt(\mathbf {A}\times \mathbf {B})=\mathbf {A}\times d\mathbf {B}/dt+d\mathbf {A}/dt\times \mathbf {B})$ we have
```{math}
\mathbf {a}=\frac{d \boldsymbol{\omega }}{dt}\times \mathbf {R}+\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \frac{d\mathbf {R}}{dt}
```
```{math}
=\boldsymbol{\alpha }\times \mathbf {R}+\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {v}
```
```{math}
|\boldsymbol{\alpha }\times \mathbf {R}|=\alpha R\sin \theta =r\alpha =a_{t}
```
Furthermore, the direction of $\boldsymbol{\alpha }\times \mathbf {R}$ is tangent to the circular path of the particle at any instant (see Fig. [](#fig-7-9)). Thus the quantity $\boldsymbol{\alpha }\times \mathbf {R}$ is just the tangential component of the total acceleration
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \mathbf {a_{t}}=\boldsymbol{\alpha }\times \mathbf {R} \end{aligned}
```
In addition
```{math}
|\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {v}|=\omega v\sin 90^{\mathrm {o}}=\omega v=r\omega ^{2}=a_{r}
```
The direction of $\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {v}$ is along the direction of $\mathrm {r}$ (radial direction). Hence, the quantity $\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {v}$ is the radial component of the total acceleration
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \mathbf {a}_{r}=\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {v} \end{aligned}
```
Equations 7.7–7.9 are the vector relationship between angular and linear quantities.

In Chap. 6 we have seen that the kinetic energy of a discrete system of particles is $K=\displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\sum _{i}m_{i}v_{i}^{2}$ where $m_{i}$ and $v_{i}$ are the mass and linear velocity of the *i*th particle respectively (see Fig. [](#fig-7-10)). From Eq. 7.5, we have

v_{i}=r_{i}\omega
```
where $r_{i}$ is the perpendicular distance from the particle to the axis of rotation. Therefore the total kinetic energy of the system is
```{math}
K_{R}=\frac{1}{2}\sum _{i}(m_{i}r_{i}^{2})\omega ^{2}
```
The quantity between brackets is known as the moment of inertia of the system
```{math}
I=\sum _{i}m_{i}r_{i}^{2}
```
This quantity shows how the mass of the system is distributed about the axis of rotation. Thus, to find the rotational inertia, the axis of rotation must be specified. If the rotational axis changes its position or direction, *I* changes as well. The SI unit of the moment of inertia is kg $\mathrm {m}^{2}$. The rotational kinetic energy can thus be written as
```{math}
K_{R}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega ^{2}
```
This quantity is the rotational analogue of the kinetic energy in translational motion. Note that this energy is not a new kind of energy; it is just the sum of the translational kinetic energies of the particles. For a rigid body which is a continuous system of particles, the sum is replaced by an integral
```{math}
I=\lim _{\triangle m_{\mathrm {i}\rightarrow 0}}\sum _{i}m_{i}r_{i}^{2}=\int r^{2}dm
```
In solving problems $\rho , \sigma$, and $\lambda$ (see Sect. 6.3.4) are often used to express *dm* in terms of its position coordinates.

## 7.6 The Parallel-Axis Theorem

The parallel-axis theorem states that the moment of inertia *I* of a system about any axis that is parallel to an axis passing through the center of mass is
```{math}
I=I_{cm}+MD^{2}
```
where $I_{cm}$ is the moment of inertia about an axis passing through the center of mass, *M* is the total mass of the system, and *D* is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes.
```{figure} ../images/ch-07/459974_1_En_7_Fig11_HTML.png
:name: fig-7-11
:alt: The Parallel-axis Theorem

The Parallel-axis Theorem
```

Proof
Consider an axis that is perpendicular to the page and passing through the center of mass of the object. Figure [](#fig-7-11) shows a thin slice of the object that lies in the x-y plane. Because the origin is taken at the center of mass we have
```{math}
z_{cm}=x_{cm}=y_{cm}=0
```
The moment of inertia of the object about the center of mass axis is
```{math}
I_{cm}=\int r^{2}dm=\int (x^{2}+y^{2})dm
```
where *x* and *y* are the coordinates of the mass element *dm* from the center of mass (the origin). Now consider another axis that is parallel to the first axis and that passes through a point $\mathrm {P}$ as shown in Fig. [](#fig-7-11). Suppose that the $\mathrm {x}$ and $\mathrm {y}$ coordinates of $\mathrm {P}$ from the center of mass are $x_{p}$ and $y_{p}$. The moment of inertia about an axis passing through $\mathrm {P}$ is
```{math}
I_{P}=\int [(x-x_{P})^{2}+(y-y_{P})^{2}]dm
```
where $(x-x_{P})$ and $(y-y_{P})$ are coordinates of *dm* from point P Expanding this equation gives
```{math}
I_{P}=\int (x^{2}+y^{2})dm-2x_{P}\int xdm-2y_{P}\int ydm+\int (x_{P}^{2}+y_{P}^{2})dm
```
Since $x_{cm}=y_{cm}=0$ and since
```{math}
x_{cm}=\frac{1}{M}\int xdm
```
and
```{math}
y_{cm}=\frac{1}{M}\int ydm
```
it follows that the second and third terms are zero. Thus
```{math}
I_{P}=I_{cm}+D^{2}\int dm
```
where
```{math}
D=\sqrt{(x_{P}^{2}+y_{P}^{2})}
```
is the perpendicular distance between the two parallel axes. Hence
```{math}
I_{P}=I_{cm}+MD^{2} \quad \text {(Parallel--Axis Theorem)}
```

## 7.7 Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body Rotating about a Fixed Axis

Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (the $\mathrm {z}$-axis) with an angular speed $\omega$ as shown in Fig. [](#fig-7-13). The angular momentum of the ith particle with respect to the origin is given by
```{math}
\mathbf {L}_{i}=\mathbf {R}_{i}\times \mathbf {p}_{i}
```
```{figure} ../images/ch-07/459974_1_En_7_Fig13_HTML.png
:name: fig-7-13
:alt: A rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (the z -axis) with an angular speed omega

A rigid body rotating about a fixed axis (the $\mathrm {z}$-axis) with an angular speed $\omega$
```

Since the angle between $\mathbf {R}_{i}$ and $\mathbf {p}_{i}$ is 90, then $L_{i}=R_{i}p_{i}$. As seen from Fig. [](#fig-7-13), $\mathbf {L}_{i}$ is not parallel to $\boldsymbol{\omega }$. $\mathbf {L}_{i}$ can be analyzed to two components, $\mathrm {a}$ component parallel to $\boldsymbol{\omega }$ written $(\mathbf {L}_{iz})$ and a component perpendicular to $\boldsymbol{\omega }$, $(\mathbf {L}_{i\perp })$. The magnitude of $\mathbf {L}_{iz}$ is given by
```{math}
L_{iz}=L_{i}\sin \theta =R_{i}p_{i}\sin \theta =R_{i} ({ m_{i} v_{i}}) \sin \theta
```
```{math}
=R_{i}m_{i}(r_{i}\omega )\sin \theta =m_{i}r_{i}^{2}\omega
```
where $r_{i}$ is the radius of the circle in which the particle is moving along and $R_{i}=r_{i}\sin \theta$. Therefore, the total angular momentum of the rigid body along the $\mathrm {z}$-direction is
```{math}
L_{z}=\sum _{i}m_{i}r_{i}^{2}\omega =\bigg (\sum _{i}m_{i}r_{i}^{2}\bigg )\omega
```
```{math}
L_{z}=I\omega
```
where *I* is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the rotational axis (z-axis). This equation can also be written in component form since $\mathbf {L}_{z}$ is parallel to $\boldsymbol{\omega }$, that is,
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \mathbf {L}_{z}=I\boldsymbol{\omega } \end{aligned}
```
Therefore, if a rigid body is rotating about a fixed axis (say the $\mathrm {z}$-axis), the component of the angular momentum along that axis is given by Eq. 7.10. Now suppose that the rigid body is symmetric and homogeneous and that it is rotating about its symmetrical axis (see Fig. [](#fig-7-14)). For any two particles (1 and 2) opposing each other with an equal angular momenta $\mathbf {L}_{1}$ and $\mathbf {L}_{2}$, the perpendicular components, $\mathbf {L}_{1\perp }$ and $\mathbf {L}_{2\perp }$, of the angular momenta cancel each other out since they are in opposite directions. That leaves the parallel components $\mathbf {L}_{1z}$ and $\mathbf {L}_{2z}$ which add up since they have the same direction. For all particles in the object the total angular momentum is, therefore, given by
```{math}
\mathbf {L}=\sum _{i}\mathbf {L}_{iz}=\mathbf {L}_{z}=I\boldsymbol{\omega }
```
Hence, the total angular momentum of a symmetrical homogeneous body in pure rotation about its symmetrical axis is given by
```{math}
\begin{aligned} \mathbf {L}=I\boldsymbol{\omega } \end{aligned}
```
Note that Eq. 7.10 is valid for any rigid object in pure rotation where it only gives the component of the angular momentum that is parallel to the rotational axis. On the other hand, Eq. 7.11 is valid only for a symmetrical homogeneous rigid object rotating about its symmetrical axis, where the angular momentum in the equation is the total angular momentum and it is directed along the axis of rotation. The net external torque acing on the rigid object is equal to the rate of change of the total angular momentum of the object, i.e.,
```{math}
\Sigma {\boldsymbol{\tau }_{ext}}=\frac{d\mathbf {L}}{dt}
```
In the case of any rigid object symmetrical or not, the net external torque acting on the object about the axis of rotation (say the $\mathrm {z}$-axis) is equal to the rate of change of the component of angular momentum that is along that axis
```{math}
\Sigma {\boldsymbol{\tau }_{extz}}=\frac{d\mathbf {L}_{z}}{dt}=\frac{d(I\boldsymbol{\omega })}{dt}=I\boldsymbol{\alpha }
```
However, if the object is symmetric and homogeneous in pure rotation about its symmetrical axis we may write
```{math}
\Sigma {\boldsymbol{\tau }_{ext}}=\frac{d\mathbf {L}}{dt}=\frac{d(I\boldsymbol{\omega })}{dt}=I\boldsymbol{\alpha }
```

## 7.8 Conservation of Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body Rotating About a Fixed Axis

In Chap. 5 we have seen that if the net external torque acting on a system of particles relative to an origin is zero then the total angular momentum of the system about that origin is conserved
```{math}
\mathbf {L}_{i}=\mathbf {L}_{f}= \mathrm{constant~(isolated~system)}
```
In the case of a rigid object in pure rotational motion, if the component of the net external torque about the rotational axis (say the $\mathrm {z}$-axis) is zero then the component of angular momentum along that axis is conserved, i.e., if
```{math}
\tau _{z}=\frac{dL_{z}}{dt}=0
```
then
```{math}
I_{i}\omega _{i}=I_{f}\omega _{f}
```
That is, the angular momentum is not necessarily conserved in all directions. It is conserved in the direction where the net external torque is equal to zero.

## 7.9 Work and Rotational Energy

Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis as in Fig. [](#fig-7-21). If a force that lies in the x-y plane is applied to the body at $\mathrm {P}$, then the work done on the body if it rotates through an angle $d\theta$ is
```{math}
dW=\mathbf {F}\cdot d\mathbf {s}=\mathbf {F}\cdot \frac{d\mathbf {s}}{dt}dt=\mathbf {F}\cdot \mathbf {v} dt=\mathbf {F}\cdot (\boldsymbol{\omega }\times \mathbf {r})dt
```
```{math}
=(\mathbf {r}\times \mathbf {F})\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega }dt=\boldsymbol{\tau }\cdot \boldsymbol{\omega }dt
```
Since $\boldsymbol{\tau }$ and $\boldsymbol{\omega }$ are parallel, (the force lies in the x-y plane therefore the total torque is parallel to the $\mathrm {z}$-axis) we have
```{math}
dW=\tau \omega dt=\tau \frac{d\theta }{dt}dt=\tau d\theta
```
Therefore, the total work done in displacing the body from $\theta _{1}$ to $\theta _{2}$ is
```{math}
\begin{aligned} W=\displaystyle \int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}\tau d\theta \end{aligned}
```
If this torque is constant we have
```{math}
W=\tau (\theta _{2}-\theta _{1})=\tau \triangle \theta
```

**The Work–Energy Theorem** The work–energy theorem states that the work done by an external force while a rigid object rotate from $\theta _{1}$ to $\theta _{2}$ is equal to the change in the rotational energy of the object. This follows from Eq. 7.12 and by using the fact that along the axis of rotation the torque is given by $\tau _{z}=I\alpha$ (see Sect. [](#sec-7-7)), thus
```{math}
W=\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}\tau d\theta =\int _{\theta _{1}}^{\theta _{2}}I\alpha d\theta =\int _{\omega _{1}}^{\omega _{2}}I\omega \frac{d\omega }{dt}dt=\int _{\omega _{1}}^{\omega _{2}}I\omega d\omega =\frac{1}{2}I\omega _{2}^{2}-\frac{1}{2}I\omega _{1}^{2}

A block of mass *m* is attached to a light string that is wrapped around the rim of a uniform solid disc of radius *R* and mass *M* as in Fig. [](#fig-7-25). Assuming that the string does not slip and that the disc rotates without friction, find: (a) the acceleration of the block; (b) the angular acceleration of the disc, and; (c) the tension in the string when the system is released from rest.

:::{admonition} Solution 7.18
:class: dropdown

The free-body diagrams of the disc and the block are shown in Fig. [](#fig-7-25). Applying Newton’s second law to the block gives

```{math}
T-mg=-ma
```

or

```{math}
\begin{aligned} a=\frac{mg-T}{m} \end{aligned}
```

where positive $\mathrm {y}$ is chosen to be directed upwards. Applying Newton’s second law in angular form to the disc gives

```{math}
\tau =RT=I\alpha
```

or

```{math}
\alpha =\frac{RT}{I}
```

Since the acceleration of the block is equal to the (tangential) acceleration of a point at the rim of the disc we have

```{math}
\begin{aligned} a=R\displaystyle \alpha =\frac{TR^{2}}{I} \end{aligned}
```

Equating Eqs. 7.13 and 7.14 gives

```{math}
\frac{TR^{2}}{I}=\frac{mg-T}{m}
```

```{math}
T=\frac{g}{1/m+R^{2}/I}=\frac{g}{1/m+2R^{2}/MR^{2}}
```

that gives

```{math}
T=\frac{mg}{1+2m/M}
```

Substituting this into Eq. 7.14

```{math}
a=\frac{TR^{2}}{I}=\frac{2TR^{2}}{MR^{2}}
```

gives

```{math}
a=\frac{g}{1+M/2m}
```

Finally

```{math}
\alpha =\frac{a}{R}=\frac{g}{R(1+M/{2m})}

(c) After seven revolutions the angular velocity is

\omega ^{2}=2\alpha \theta =2(3 \; \mathrm {r}\mathrm {a}\mathrm {d}/\mathrm {s}^{2}) ( 44 \; \text {rad})
